Level Info

The password for level 2 is in the file ‘krypton2’. It is ‘encrypted’ using a simple rotation. It is also in non-standard ciphertext format. When using alpha characters for cipher text it is normal to group the letters into 5 letter clusters, regardless of word boundaries. This helps obfuscate any patterns. This file has kept the plain text word boundaries and carried them to the cipher text. Enjoy!

Welcome to Krypton!

This game is intended to give hands on experience with cryptography
and cryptanalysis.  The levels progress from classic ciphers, to modern,
easy to harder.

Although there are excellent public tools, like cryptool,to perform
the simple analysis, we strongly encourage you to try and do these
without them for now.  We will use them in later excercises.

** Please try these levels without cryptool first **

The first level is easy.  The password for level 2 is in the file 
'krypton2'.  It is 'encrypted' using a simple rotation called ROT13.  
It is also in non-standard ciphertext format.  When using alpha characters for
cipher text it is normal to group the letters into 5 letter clusters, 
regardless of word boundaries.  This helps obfuscate any patterns.

This file has kept the plain text word boundaries and carried them to
the cipher text.

Enjoy!

Krypton Level 2

ssh krypton2@krypton.labs.overthewire.org -p 2231
ROTTEN

Level Info

ROT13 is a simple substitution cipher.

Substitution ciphers are a simple replacement algorithm. In this example of a substitution cipher, we will explore a ‘monoalphebetic’ cipher. Monoalphebetic means, literally, “one alphabet” and you will see why.

This level contains an old form of cipher called a ‘Caesar Cipher’. A Caesar cipher shifts the alphabet by a set number. For example:

plain:  a b c d e f g h i j k ...
cipher: G H I J K L M N O P Q ...

In this example, the letter ‘a’ in plaintext is replaced by a ‘G’ in the ciphertext so, for example, the plaintext ‘bad’ becomes ‘HGJ’ in ciphertext.

The password for level 3 is in the file krypton3. It is in 5 letter group ciphertext. It is encrypted with a Caesar Cipher. Without any further information, this cipher text may be difficult to break. You do not have direct access to the key, however you do have access to a program that will encrypt anything you wish to give it using the key. If you think logically, this is completely easy.

One shot can solve it!

Have fun.

Additional Information:

The encrypt binary will look for the keyfile in your current working directory. Therefore, it might be best to create a working direcory in /tmp and in there a link to the keyfile. As the encrypt binary runs setuid krypton3, you also need to give krypton3 access to your working directory.

Here is an example:

krypton2@melinda:~$ mktemp -d
/tmp/tmp.Wf2OnCpCDQ
krypton2@melinda:~$ cd /tmp/tmp.Wf2OnCpCDQ
krypton2@melinda:/tmp/tmp.Wf2OnCpCDQ$ ln -s /krypton/krypton2/keyfile.dat

Level Info

Well done. You’ve moved past an easy substitution cipher.

The main weakness of a simple substitution cipher is repeated use of a simple key. In the previous exercise you were able to introduce arbitrary plaintext to expose the key. In this example, the cipher mechanism is not available to you, the attacker.

However, you have been lucky. You have intercepted more than one message. The password to the next level is found in the file ‘krypton4’. You have also found 3 other files. (found1, found2, found3)

You know the following important details:

    The message plaintexts are in American English (*** very important) - They were produced from the same key (*** even better!)

Enjoy.

Good job!

You more than likely used some form of FA and some common sense to solve that one.

So far we have worked with simple substitution ciphers. They have also been ‘monoalphabetic’, meaning using a fixed key, and giving a one to one mapping of plaintext (P) to ciphertext (C). Another type of substitution cipher is referred to as ‘polyalphabetic’, where one character of P may map to many, or all, possible ciphertext characters.

An example of a polyalphabetic cipher is called a Vigenère Cipher. It works like this:

If we use the key(K) ‘GOLD’, and P = PROCEED MEETING AS AGREED, then “add” P to K, we get C. When adding, if we exceed 25, then we roll to 0 (modulo 26).

P P R O C E E D M E E T I N G A S A G R E E D\
K G O L D G O L D G O L D G O L D G O L D G O\

becomes:

P 15 17 14 2 4 4 3 12 4 4 19 8 13 6 0 18 0 6 17 4 4 3\
K 6 14 11 3 6 14 11 3 6 14 11 3 6 14 11 3 6 14 11 3 6 14\
C 21 5 25 5 10 18 14 15 10 18 4 11 19 20 11 21 6 20 2 8 10 17\

So, we get a ciphertext of:

VFZFK SOPKS ELTUL VGUCH KR

This level is a Vigenère Cipher. You have intercepted two longer, english language messages (American English). You also have a key piece of information. You know the key length!

For this exercise, the key length is 6. The password to level five is in the usual place, encrypted with the 6 letter key.

Have fun!

Frequency analysis will still work, but you need to analyse it
by "keylength".  Analysis of cipher text at position 1, 6, 12, etc
should reveal the 1st letter of the key, in this case.  Treat this as
6 different mono-alphabetic ciphers...

Persistence and some good guesses are the key!

RANDOM

ssh krypton6@krypton.labs.overthewire.org -p 2231
RANDOM

Hopefully by now its obvious that encryption using repeating keys is a bad idea. Frequency analysis can destroy repeating/fixed key substitution crypto.

A feature of good crypto is random ciphertext. A good cipher must not reveal any clues about the plaintext. Since natural language plaintext (in this case, English) contains patterns, it is left up to the encryption key or the encryption algorithm to add the ‘randomness’.

Modern ciphers are similar to older plain substitution ciphers, but improve the ‘random’ nature of the key.

An example of an older cipher using a complex, random, large key is a vigniere using a key of the same size of the plaintext. For example, imagine you and your confident have agreed on a key using the book ‘A Tale of Two Cities’ as your key, in 256 byte blocks.

The cipher works as such:

Each plaintext message is broken into 256 byte blocks. For each block of plaintext, a corresponding 256 byte block from the book is used as the key, starting from the first chapter, and progressing. No part of the book is ever re-used as key. The use of a key of the same length as the plaintext, and only using it once is called a “One Time Pad”.

Look in the krypton6 directory. You will find a file called ‘plain1’, a 256 byte block. You will also see a file ‘key1’, the first 256 bytes of ‘A Tale of Two Cities’. The file ‘cipher1’ is the cipher text of plain1. As you can see (and try) it is very difficult to break the cipher without the key knowledge.

If the encryption is truly random letters, and only used once, then it is impossible to break. A truly random “One Time Pad” key cannot be broken. Consider intercepting a ciphertext message of 1000 bytes. One could brute force for the key, but due to the random key nature, you would produce every single valid 1000 letter plaintext as well. Who is to know which is the real plaintext?!?

Choosing keys that are the same size as the plaintext is impractical. Therefore, other methods must be used to obscure ciphertext against frequency analysis in a simple substitution cipher. The impracticality of an ‘infinite’ key means that the randomness, or entropy, of the encryption is introduced via the method.

We have seen the method of ‘substitution’. Even in modern crypto, substitution is a valid technique. Another technique is ‘transposition’, or swapping of bytes.

Modern ciphers break into two types; symmetric and asymmetric.

Symmetric ciphers come in two flavours: block and stream.

Until now, we have been playing with classical ciphers, approximating ‘block’ ciphers. A block cipher is done in fixed size blocks (suprise!). For example, in the previous paragraphs we discussed breaking text and keys into 256 byte blocks, and working on those blocks. Block ciphers use a fixed key to perform substituion and transposition ciphers on each block discretely.

Its time to employ a stream cipher. A stream cipher attempts to create an on-the-fly ‘random’ keystream to encrypt the incoming plaintext one byte at a time. Typically, the ‘random’ key byte is xor’d with the plaintext to produce the ciphertext. If the random keystream can be replicated at the recieving end, then a further xor will produce the plaintext once again.

From this example forward, we will be working with bytes, not ASCII text, so a hex editor/dumper like hexdump is a necessity. Now is the right time to start to learn to use tools like cryptool.

In this example, the keyfile is in your directory, however it is not readable by you. The binary ‘encrypt6’ is also available. It will read the keyfile and encrypt any message you desire, using the key AND a ‘random’ number. You get to perform a ‘known ciphertext’ attack by introducing plaintext of your choice. The challenge here is not simple, but the ‘random’ number generator is weak.

As stated, it is now that we suggest you begin to use public tools, like cryptool, to help in your analysis. You will most likely need a hint to get going. See ‘HINT1’ if you need a kicktstart.

If you have further difficulty, there is a hint in ‘HINT2’.

The password for level 7 (krypton7) is encrypted with ‘encrypt6’.

Good Luck!

  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
  compiler flags might be interesting:

    -m32                    compile for 32bit
    -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
    -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.

A little bit of Theory

ROT13 is an easy substitution cryptosystem based on the Caesar cipher but with 13 as the key. This key has the advantage that the encryption function is the same as the decryption function for the Latin alphabet with 26 letters. This also exists for the 10 digits and is called ROT5.

The Caesar cipher is a shift cipher, meaning the letters are shifted by a certain number (the key). For example, with k=1, you encrypt A as B, B as C and so on until Z will be encrypted as A.

The bash command alias allows you to create shorter names for common commands. The structure is: alias <alias_name>="<lang_common_command>"

tr is the translate command. It allows you to replace or delete characters. It is used in UNIX pipes (find out more see [Bandit Level 6]https://mayadevbe.me/posts/overthewire/bandit/level6/). The structure for replacing characters is the following: tr '<initial_chars>' 'replacement_chars'. For example echo 'A' | tr 'A' 'a' would return a.

A little bit of Theory

The Caesar Cipher is a shift cipher, meaning the letters are shifted by a certain number (the key). For example, with k=1, you encrypt A as B, B as C and so on until Z will be encrypted as A. Calculating the encryption key is easy, when knowing just one letter pair of the message (original) and cipher text (encrypted). Taking the example from above: ‘A’ to ‘B’ is ‘1 -> 2’. The key is just the difference ‘1+x=2’ (as long as it does not wrap around). To calculate the decryption key from the encryption key, you can do the following: amount of characters - encryption_key = decryption_key. So the example would be ‘26-1=25’. Meaning, you need to shift ‘B’ by 25 to get ‘A’ again. (2+25= 27 mod 26 = 1). Here ‘mod’ is revering to the modulo operation that is the remainder of a division. It is needed because the number needs to be between 1 and 26 to be mapped to a letter of the alphabet.

A little bit of Theory

The problem with using one key repeatedly on a block of letters is that there will be a pattern. The more text will be encrypted with the same key the easier it is to find the pattern. Meaning, for different languages we can guess the key based on looking at the character with the biggest amount and assuming it is the character that is used most often in the English language. Quick googling will tell us that is the letter ’e’. This is based on the letter frequency and its entropy. It is used to do Frequency analysis. This is a method to break classical ciphers. Basically, you just count all letters (sometimes also combinations of letters) and based on how often they appear you assign them in order of the most frequent letters of the language.

A little bit of Theory

The task explanation gives a short explanation of what a Vigenère Cipher is. The Caesar cipher is a simplification of the Vigenère Cipher. Instead of one number that is used to encrypt the whole text, the Vigenère Cipher uses a secret key. This key is used to encrypt blocks of the length of the key. It is generally a word, however, for encryption the letters will be exchanged with their position in the alphabet. Therefore if the key would be length one, it would be the Caesar cipher.

A little bit of Theory

The Kasiski examination is an attack on polyalphabetic cipher that makes it possible to guess the key length. The method looks for repeated sequences and their offsets/distances. The greatest common divisor of the offsets would most likely be the key length.

A Little Bit Of Theory

This level introduces the notion of repeating keys as insecure, as Frequency Analysis can be used to quickly determine the key, and we've been using block ciphers. We're now moving on to the world of stream ciphers which are another type of symmetric cipher.

These ciphers create random keys, which are then used to encrypt one character at a time, typically using an XOR function, combining the output with the keystream. In this level, we're introduced to the notion of Linear-Feedback Shift Registers. These take taps off the binary data and XOR them together to get a result. The result of this function is then pushed onto the end of the binary blob, where the digit on the other end is dropped off. Computerphile has a great video that explains it further here.
