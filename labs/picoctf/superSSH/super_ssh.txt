Description
Using a Secure Shell (SSH) is going to be pretty important.

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

Can you ssh as ctf-player to titan.picoctf.net at port 51450 to get the flag? You'll also need the password 84b12bae. If asked, accept the fingerprint with yes. If your device doesn't have a shell, you can use: https://webshell.picoctf.org If you're not sure what a shell is, check out our Primer: https://primer.picoctf.com/#_the_shell
