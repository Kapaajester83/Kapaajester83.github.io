Hints

You might want to check the ASCII table to first find the hexadecimal representation of characters before finding the endianness.

CLI

kappa@kappa-Aspire-Z5600:~$ nc titan.picoctf.net 53996
Welcome to the Endian CTF!
You need to find both the little endian and big endian representations of a word.
If you get both correct, you will receive the flag.
Word: ofexh

Enter the Little Endian representation: 687865666f
Correct Little Endian representation!

Enter the Big Endian representation: 6f66657868
Correct Big Endian representation!

Congratulations! You found both endian representations correctly!
Your Flag is: picoCTF{3ndi4n_sw4p_su33ess_91bc76a4}

In a new terminal

kappa@kappa-Aspire-Z5600:~$ echo -n "ofexh" | hexdump --format '/1 "%02x"'
6f66657868kappa@kappa-Aspire-Z5600:~$

Hex:6f66657868

rotate the hex characters to find

6f 66 65 78 68 - big
68 78 65 66 6f - little

eliminate the spaces
