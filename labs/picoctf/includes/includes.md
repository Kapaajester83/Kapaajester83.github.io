Hints

Is there more code than what the inspector initially shows?

CLI

Popup says the file is split, and if you look at the page source there are two includes that contain pieces of the flag

style.css - picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_
script.js - f7w_2of2_6edef411}

flag - picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_f7w_2of2_6edef411}
