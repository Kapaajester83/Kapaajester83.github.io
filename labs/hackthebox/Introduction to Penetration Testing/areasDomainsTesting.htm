          <h3><em>Areas and Domains of Testing</em></h3>

          <p>In addition to these three fundamental (Black box, Gray box, White box) testing types, penetration testing can also be classified based on the specific target environment or domain being assessed. This environment-specific approach allows for a more focused and specialized evaluation, where the penetration test is specifically focused to address the unique security challenges and vulnerabilities associated with a particular technological ecosystem or infrastructure component. Rather than conducting a broad-spectrum security assessment, this type of testing concentrates exclusively on thoroughly examining and testing the company's infrastructure's environment. Such environments can be, but not limited to:
          <ul>
            <li>Network Infrastructure</li>
            <li>Web Applications</li>
            <li>Mobile Applications</li>
            <li>Cloud Infrastructure</li>
            <li>Physical Security</li>
            <li>Wireless Security</li>
            <li>Software Security</li>
          </ul>

          <p>These specialized testing domains can serve as potential career paths or areas of expertise within the penetration testing field. As you progress in your cybersecurity journey and gain a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts and methodologies, you'll likely discover that certain types of testing resonate more strongly with your interests and skillset. This natural gravitation towards specific testing domains often leads to the development of deep expertise in particular areas, whether it's web application security, network infrastructure testing, mobile security assessments, or other specialized fields. Many successful penetration testers find themselves developing a particular affinity for and proficiency in one or more of these specialized areas, which can ultimately shape their professional trajectory and help them establish themselves as subject matter experts in their chosen domain.</p>

          <p>In penetration testing, understanding the different areas and domains is crucial for conducting thorough specialized security assessments. These domains represent distinct aspects of an organization's infrastructure that need to be evaluated for vulnerabilities and security weaknesses. Each domain requires specific tools, methodologies, and expertise to test effectively.</p>

          <h4>Network Infrastructure Testing</h4>

          <p>Network infrastructure testing is one of the most fundamental areas of penetration testing. In this domain we focus on examining all network-connected devices, including routers, firewalls, switches, and many other network equipment. We look for misconfigurations, weak passwords, outdated firmware, and security flaws that could allow unauthorized access.
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/295/networksec.jpg">https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/295/networksec.jpg</a></li>
          </ul>

          <p>Common activities in network testing include port scanning, service enumeration, and analyzing network protocols. Testers also examine network segmentation to ensure that sensitive areas are properly isolated from less secure zones. This helps identify potential paths that attackers might use to move laterally within the network.</p>

          <h4>Web Application Security Testing</h4>

          <p>Web application testing has become increasingly important as organizations rely more heavily on web-based services. This domain involves testing websites, web applications, and web services for security vulnerabilities. Testers look for common issues like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), broken authentication, and insecure direct object references.
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/295/webapps.jpg">https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/295/webapps.jpg</a></li>
          </ul>

          <p>The testing process includes examining both the front-end interface and back-end functionality. Testers evaluate how the application handles user input, manages sessions, and protects sensitive data. They also assess the security of API endpoints and third-party integrations that could potentially expose vulnerabilities.</p>

          <h4>Mobile Application Security Testing</h4>

          <p>With the proliferation of mobile devices, mobile application security testing has become a critical domain. This area focuses on identifying vulnerabilities in mobile apps, including issues with data storage, communication protocols, and authentication mechanisms. Testers examine both Android and iOS applications, looking for ways that malicious actors could compromise user data or gain unauthorized access.
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/295/mobile.jpg">https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/295/mobile.jpg</a></li>
          </ul>

          <p>Mobile app testing involves analyzing how apps store sensitive information, checking for proper encryption implementation, and examining how apps communicate with back-end servers. Testers also look for vulnerabilities in the app's runtime environment and evaluate whether the app properly validates certificates and handles secure communications.</p>

          <h4>Cloud Infrastructure Security Testing</h4>

          <p>As organizations migrate to cloud services, cloud infrastructure testing has become essential. This domain involves evaluating the security of cloud-based resources, including virtual machines, storage buckets, and containerized applications. Testers check for misconfigurations in cloud services, improper access controls, and vulnerabilities in cloud-native applications.
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/295/cloud.jpg">https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/295/cloud.jpg</a></li>
          </ul>

          <p>Testing in this domain requires understanding various cloud service providers (like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud) and their specific security models. Testers examine identity and access management (IAM) configurations, network security groups, and data storage permissions to ensure proper security controls are in place.</p>

          <h4>Physical Security Testing and Social Engineering</h4>

          <p>Social engineering testing assesses an organization's human element - often considered the weakest link in security. This domain includes testing employees' susceptibility to phishing attacks, pretexting, and other social manipulation techniques. Physical security testing involves evaluating the security of physical locations, including access controls, security cameras, and badge systems.
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/295/physical.jpg">https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/295/physical.jpg</a></li>
          </ul>

          <p>These tests help organizations identify gaps in security awareness training and physical security measures. Testers might attempt to gain unauthorized access to buildings, test the effectiveness of security personnel, or conduct simulated phishing campaigns to evaluate employee awareness.</p>

          <h4>Wireless Network Security Testing</h4>

          <p>Wireless network testing focuses on evaluating the security of Wi-Fi networks and other wireless communications. This includes testing wireless encryption protocols, examining access point configurations, and identifying rogue devices. Testers look for vulnerabilities that could allow unauthorized access to wireless networks or enable eavesdropping on wireless communications.
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/295//wifi.jpg">https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/295//wifi.jpg</a></li>
          </ul>

          <p>The testing process involves analyzing wireless signal coverage, evaluating authentication mechanisms, and checking for proper network segmentation between wireless and wired networks. Testers also examine how guest networks are isolated from corporate networks and verify that proper security controls are in place.</p>

          <h4>Software Testing</h4>

          <p>Software security testing involves examining applications, operating systems, and firmware for security vulnerabilities. This domain focuses on identifying weaknesses in software code, architecture, and implementation that could be exploited by attackers. Testers analyze both compiled executables and source code to find potential security flaws.
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/295/software.jpg">https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/295/software.jpg</a></li>
          </ul>

          <p>The testing process includes static and dynamic analysis, reverse engineering, and fuzzing to identify buffer overflows, memory leaks, and other software vulnerabilities. Testers also evaluate how the software handles input validation, memory management, and error handling to ensure robust security controls are implemented.</p>

          <p>Each testing domain requires specific skills, tools, and methodologies. A comprehensive penetration test often done by a team since it involves multiple domains to provide a complete picture of an organization's security posture. Understanding these different areas helps testers plan and execute more effective security assessments, ultimately helping organizations better protect their assets and information.</p>

          <p>Remember that these domains are not isolated - they often overlap and interact with each other. For example, a web application might be hosted in a cloud environment and accessed through both mobile apps and traditional web browsers. This interconnected nature means that thorough security testing requires a holistic approach that considers how vulnerabilities in one domain might affect others.</p>
