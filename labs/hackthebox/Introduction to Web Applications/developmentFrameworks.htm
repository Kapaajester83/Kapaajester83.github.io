        <h3><em>Development Frameworks & APIs</em></h3>

        <p>In addition to web servers that can host web applications in various languages, there are many common web development frameworks that help in developing core web application files and functionality. With the increased complexity of web applications, it may be challenging to create a modern and sophisticated web application from scratch. Hence, most of the popular web applications are developed using web frameworks.</p>

        <p>As most web applications share common functionality -such as user registration-, web development frameworks make it easy to quickly implement this functionality and link them to the front end components, making a fully functional web application. Some of the most common web development frameworks include:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Laravel (PHP):</b> - usually used by startups and smaller companies, as it is powerful yet easy to develop for.</li>
          <li><b>Express (Node.JS):</b> - used by PayPal, Yahoo, Uber, IBM, and MySpace.</li>
          <li><b>Django (Python):</b> - used by Google, YouTube, Instagram, Mozilla, and Pinterest.</li>
          <li><b>Rails (Ruby):</b> - used by GitHub, Hulu, Twitch, Airbnb, and even Twitter in the past.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It must be noted that popular websites usually utilize a variety of frameworks and web servers, rather than just one.</p>

        <h4>APIs</h4>

        <p>An important aspect of back end web application development is the use of Web APIs and HTTP Request parameters to connect the front end and the back end to be able to send data back and forth between front end and back end components and carry out various functions within the web application.</p>

        <p>For the front end component to interact with the back end and ask for certain tasks to be carried out, they utilize APIs to ask the back end component for a specific task with specific input. The back end components process these requests, perform the necessary functions, and return a certain response to the front end components, which finally renderers the end user's output on the client-side.</p>

        <h4>Query Parameters</h4>

        <p>The default method of sending specific arguments to a web page is through GET and POST request parameters. This allows the front end components to specify values for certain parameters used within the page for the back end components to process them and respond accordingly.</p>

        <p>For example, a /search.php page would take an item parameter, which may be used to specify the search item. Passing a parameter through a GET request is done through the URL '/search.php?item=apples', while POST parameters are passed through POST data at the bottom of the POST HTTP request:</p>

        <pre>
          POST /search.php HTTP/1.1
          ...SNIP...

          item=apples
        </pre>

        <p>Query parameters allow a single page to receive various types of input, each of which can be processed differently. For certain other scenarios, Web APIs may be much quicker and more efficient to use. The Web Requests module takes a deeper dive into HTTP requests.</p>

        <h4>Web APIs</h4>

        <p>An API (Application Programming Interface) is an interface within an application that specifies how the application can interact with other applications. For Web Applications, it is what allows remote access to functionality on back end components. APIs are not exclusive to web applications and are used for software applications in general. Web APIs are usually accessed over the HTTP protocol and are usually handled and translated through web servers.

        </ul>

        <p>A weather web application, for example, may have a certain API to retrieve the current weather for a certain city. We can request the API URL and pass the city name or city id, and it would return the current weather in a JSON object. Another example is Twitter's API, which allows us to retrieve the latest Tweets from a certain account in XML or JSON formats, and even allows us to send a Tweet 'if authenticated', and so on.</p>

        <p>To enable the use of APIs within a web application, the developers have to develop this functionality on the back end of the web application by using the API standards like SOAP or REST.</p>

        <h4>SOAP</h4>

        <p>The SOAP (Simple Objects Access) standard shares data through XML, where the request is made in XML through an HTTP request, and the response is also returned in XML. Front end components are designed to parse this XML output properly.</p>

        <p>SOAP is very useful for transferring structured data (i.e., an entire class object), or even binary data, and is often used with serialized objects, all of which enables sharing complex data between front end and back end components and parsing it properly. It is also very useful for sharing stateful objects -i.e., sharing/changing the current state of a web page-, which is becoming more common with modern web applications and mobile applications.</p>

        <p>However, SOAP may be difficult to use for beginners or require long and complicated requests even for smaller queries, like basic search or filter queries. This is where the REST API standard is more useful.</p>

        <h4>REST</h4>

        <p>The REST (Representational State Transfer) standard shares data through the URL path 'i.e. search/users/1', and usually returns the output in JSON format 'i.e. userid 1'.</p>

        <p>Unlike Query Parameters, REST APIs usually focus on pages that expect one type of input passed directly through the URL path, without specifying its name or type. This is usually useful for queries like search, sort, or filter. This is why REST APIs usually break web application functionality into smaller APIs and utilize these smaller API requests to allow the web application to perform more advanced actions, making the web application more modular and scalable.</p>

        <p>Responses to REST API requests are usually made in JSON format, and the front end components are then developed to handle this response and render it properly. Other output formats for REST include XML, x-www-form-urlencoded, or even raw data. As seen previously in the database section, the following is an example of a JSON response to the GET /category/posts/ API request:</p>

        <pre>
          Code: json

          {
            "100001": {
              "date": "01-01-2021",
              "content": "Welcome to this web application."
            },
            "100002": {
              "date": "02-01-2021",
              "content": "This is the first post on this web app."
            },
            "100003": {
              "date": "02-01-2021",
              "content": "Reminder: Tomorrow is the ..."
            }
          }
        </pre>

        <p>REST uses various HTTP methods to perform different actions on the web application:
        <ul>
          <li><b>GET</b> - request to retrieve data</li>
          <li><b>POST</b> - request to create data (non-idempotent)</li>
          <li><b>PUT</b> - request to create or replace existing data (idempotent)</li>
          <li><b>DELETE</b> - request to remove data</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Questions</h4>

        <p>Use GET request '/index.php?id=0' to search for the name of the user with id number 1?</p>
