        <h3><em>Privilege Escalation</em></h3>

        <p>Our initial access to a remote server is usually in the context of a low-privileged user, which would not give us complete access over the box. To gain full access, we will need to find an internal/local vulnerability that would escalate our privileges to the root user on Linux or the administrator/SYSTEM user on Windows. Let us walk through some common methods of escalating our privileges.</p>

        <h4>PrivEsc Checklists</h4>

        <p>Once we gain initial access to a box, we want to thoroughly enumerate the box to find any potential vulnerabilities we can exploit to achieve a higher privilege level. We can find many checklists and cheat sheets online that have a collection of checks we can run and the commands to run these checks. One excellent resource is HackTricks, which has an excellent checklist for both Linux and Windows local privilege escalation. Another excellent repository is PayloadsAllTheThings, which also has checklists for both Linux and Windows. We must start experimenting with various commands and techniques and get familiar with them to understand multiple weaknesses that can lead to escalating our privileges.</p>

        <h4>Enumeration Scripts</h4>

        <p>Many of the above commands may be automatically run with a script to go through the report and look for any weaknesses. We can run many scripts to automatically enumerate the server by running common commands that return any interesting findings. Some of the common Linux enumeration scripts include LinEnum and linuxprivchecker, and for Windows include Seatbelt and JAWS.</p>

        <p>Another useful tool we may use for server enumeration is the Privilege Escalation Awesome Scripts SUITE (PEASS), as it is well maintained to remain up to date and includes scripts for enumerating both Linux and Windows.</p>

        <p>Note: These scripts will run many commands known for identifying vulnerabilities and create a lot of "noise" that may trigger anti-virus software or security monitoring software that looks for these types of events. This may prevent the scripts from running or even trigger an alarm that the system has been compromised. In some instances, we may want to do a manual enumeration instead of running scripts.</p>

        <p>Let us take an example of running the Linux script from PEASS called LinPEAS:</p>

        <h5>
          kappajester83@htb[/htb]$ ./linpeas.sh<br>
          ...SNIP...
        </h5>

        </ul>

        <pre>
          LEYEND:
            RED/YELLOW: 99% a PE vector
            RED: You must take a look at it
            LightCyan: Users with console
            Blue: Users without console & mounted devs
            Green: Common things (users, groups, SUID/SGID, mounts, .sh scripts, cronjobs)
            LightMangenta: Your username

          ====================================( Basic information )=====================================
          OS: Linux version 3.9.0-73-generic
          User & Groups: uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
          ...SNIP...
        </pre>

        <p>As we can see, once the script runs, it starts collecting information and displaying it in an excellent report. Let us discuss some of the vulnerabilities that we should look for in the output from these scripts.</p>

        <h4>Kernel Exploits</h4>

        <p>Whenever we encounter a server running an old operating system, we should start by looking for potential kernel vulnerabilities that may exist. Suppose the server is not being maintained with the latest updates and patches. In that case, it is likely vulnerable to specific kernel exploits found on unpatched versions of Linux and Windows.</p>

        <p>For example, the above script showed us the Linux version to be 3.9.0-73-generic. If we Google exploits for this version or use searchsploit, we would find a CVE-2016-5195, otherwise known as DirtyCow. We can search for and download the DirtyCow exploit and run it on the server to gain root access.</p>

        <p>The same concept also applies to Windows, as there are many vulnerabilities in unpatched/older versions of Windows, with various vulnerabilities that can be used for privilege escalation. We should keep in mind that kernel exploits can cause system instability, and we should take great care before running them on production systems. It is best to try them in a lab environment and only run them on production systems with explicit approval and coordination with our client.</p>

        <h4>Vulnerable Software</h4>

        <p>Another thing we should look for is installed software. For example, we can use the dpkg -l command on Linux or look at C:\Program Files in Windows to see what software is installed on the system. We should look for public exploits for any installed software, especially if any older versions are in use, containing unpatched vulnerabilities.</p>

        <h4>User Privileges</h4>

        <p>Another critical aspect to look for after gaining access to a server is the privileges available to the user we have access to. Suppose we are allowed to run specific commands as root (or as another user). In that case, we may be able to escalate our privileges to root/system users or gain access as a different user. Below are some common ways to exploit certain user privileges:
        <ul>
          <li>Sudo</li>
          <li>SUID</li>
          <li>Windows Token Privileges</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The sudo command in Linux allows a user to execute commands as a different user. It is usually used to allow lower privileged users to execute commands as root without giving them access to the root user. This is generally done as specific commands can only be run as root 'like tcpdump' or allow the user to access certain root-only directories. We can check what sudo privileges we have with the sudo -l command:</p>

        <h5>kappajester83@htb[/htb]$ sudo -l</h5>

        <pre>
          [sudo] password for user1:
          ...SNIP...
          User user1 may run the following commands on ExampleServer:
            (ALL : ALL) ALL
        </pre>

        <p>The above output says that we can run all commands with sudo, which gives us complete access, and we can use the su command with sudo to switch to the root user:</p>

        <h5>kappajester83@htb[/htb]$ sudo su -</h5>

        <pre>
          [sudo] password for user1:
          whoami
          root
        </pre>

        <p>The above command requires a password to run any commands with sudo. There are certain occasions where we may be allowed to execute certain applications, or all applications, without having to provide a password:</p>

        <h5>
          kappajester83@htb[/htb]$ sudo -l<br>
          (user : user) NOPASSWD: /bin/echo
        </h5>

        <p>The NOPASSWD entry shows that the /bin/echo command can be executed without a password. This would be useful if we gained access to the server through a vulnerability and did not have the user's password. As it says user, we can run sudo as that user and not as root. To do so, we can specify the user with -u user:</p>

        <h5>
          kappajester83@htb[/htb]$ sudo -u user /bin/echo Hello World!<br>
          Hello World!
        </h5>

        <p>Once we find a particular application we can run with sudo, we can look for ways to exploit it to get a shell as the root user. <a href="https://gtfobins.github.io">GTFOBins</a> contains a list of commands and how they can be exploited through sudo. We can search for the application we have sudo privilege over, and if it exists, it may tell us the exact command we should execute to gain root access using the sudo privilege we have.</p>

        <p><a href="https://lolbas-project.github.io">LOLBAS</a> also contains a list of Windows applications which we may be able to leverage to perform certain functions, like downloading files or executing commands in the context of a privileged user.</p>

        <h4>Scheduled Tasks</h4>

        <p>In both Linux and Windows, there are methods to have scripts run at specific intervals to carry out a task. Some examples are having an anti-virus scan running every hour or a backup script that runs every 30 minutes. There are usually two ways to take advantage of scheduled tasks (Windows) or cron jobs (Linux) to escalate our privileges:
        <ul>
          <li>Add new scheduled tasks/cron jobs</li>
          <li>Trick them to execute a malicious software</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The easiest way is to check if we are allowed to add new scheduled tasks. In Linux, a common form of maintaining scheduled tasks is through Cron Jobs. There are specific directories that we may be able to utilize to add new cron jobs if we have the write permissions over them. These include:
        <ul>
          <li>/etc/crontab</li>
          <li>/etc/cron.d,</li>
          <li>/var/spool/cron/crontabs/root</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If we can write to a directory called by a cron job, we can write a bash script with a reverse shell command, which should send us a reverse shell when executed.</p>

        <h4>Exposed Credentials</h4>

        <p>Next, we can look for files we can read and see if they contain any exposed credentials. This is very common with configuration files, log files, and user history files (bash_history in Linux and PSReadLine in Windows). The enumeration scripts we discussed at the beginning usually look for potential passwords in files and provide them to us, as below:</p>

        <pre>
          ...SNIP...
          [+] Searching passwords in config PHP files
          [+] Finding passwords inside logs (limit 70)
          ...SNIP...
          /var/www/html/config.php: $conn = new mysqli(localhost, 'db_user', 'password123');
        </pre>

        <p>As we can see, the database password 'password123' is exposed, which would allow us to log in to the local mysql databases and look for interesting information. We may also check for Password Reuse, as the system user may have used their password for the databases, which may allow us to use the same password to switch to that user, as follows:</p>

        <h5>
          kappajester83@htb[/htb]$ su -<br>
          Password: password123<br>
          whoami<br>
          root
        </h5>

        <p>We may also use the user credentials to ssh into the server as that user.</p>

        <h4>SSH Keys</h4>

        <p>Finally, let us discuss SSH keys. If we have read access over the .ssh directory for a specific user, we may read their private ssh keys found in /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa or /root/.ssh/id_rsa, and use it to log in to the server. If we can read the /root/.ssh/ directory and can read the id_rsa file, we can copy it to our machine and use the -i flag to log in with it:</p>

        <h5>
          kappajester83@htb[/htb]$ vim id_rsa
          kappajester83@htb[/htb]$ chmod 600 id_rsa
          kappajester83@htb[/htb]$ ssh root@10.10.10.10 -i id_rsa
          root@10.10.10.10#
        </h5>

        <p>Note that we used the command 'chmod 600 id_rsa' on the key after we created it on our machine to change the file's permissions to be more restrictive. If ssh keys have lax permissions, i.e., maybe read by other people, the ssh server would prevent them from working.</p>

        <p>If we find ourselves with write access to a users/.ssh/ directory, we can place our public key in the user's ssh directory at /home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys. This technique is usually used to gain ssh access after gaining a shell as that user. The current SSH configuration will not accept keys written by other users, so it will only work if we have already gained control over that user. We must first create a new key with ssh-keygen and the -f flag to specify the output file:</p>

        <h5>kappajester83@htb[/htb]$ ssh-keygen -f key</h5>

        <pre>
          Generating public/private rsa key pair.
          Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): *******
          Enter same passphrase again: *******

          Your identification has been saved in key
          Your public key has been saved in key.pub
          The key fingerprint is:
          SHA256:...SNIP... user@parrot
          The key's randomart image is:
          +---[RSA 3072]----+
          |   ..o.++.+      |
          ...SNIP...
          |     . ..oo+.    |
          +----[SHA256]-----+
        </pre>

        <p>This will give us two files: key (which we will use with ssh -i) and key.pub, which we will copy to the remote machine. Let us copy key.pub, then on the remote machine, we will add it into /root/.ssh/authorized_keys:</p>

        <h5>user@remotehost$ echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB...SNIP...M= user@parrot" >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys</h5>

        <p>Now, the remote server should allow us to log in as that user by using our private key:</p>

        <h5>
          kappajester83@htb[/htb]$ ssh root@10.10.10.10 -i key<br>
          root@remotehost#
        </h5>

        <p>As we can see, we can now ssh in as the user root. The Linux Privilege Escalation and the Windows Privilege Escalation modules go into more details on how to use each of these methods for Privilege Escalation, and many others as well.</p>
