Answer the question(s) below to complete this Section and earn cubes!
+ 2 Which probabilistic algorithm, based on Bayes' theorem, is commonly used for classification tasks such as spam filtering and sentiment analysis, and is known for its simplicity, efficiency, and good performance in real-world scenarios?

+10 Streak pts
+ 2 What dimensionality reduction technique transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional representation while preserving as much original information as possible, and is widely used for feature extraction, data visualization, and noise reduction?

+ 2 What model-free reinforcement learning algorithm learns an optimal policy by estimating the Q-value, which represents the expected cumulative reward an agent can obtain by taking a specific action in a given state and following the optimal policy afterward? This algorithm learns directly through trial and error, interacting with the environment and observing the outcomes.

+ 2 What is the fundamental computational unit in neural networks that receives inputs, processes them using weights and a bias, and applies an activation function to produce an output? Unlike the perceptron, which uses a step function for binary classification, this unit can use various activation functions such as the sigmoid, ReLU, and tanh.

+ 2 What deep learning architecture, known for its ability to process sequential data like text by capturing long-range dependencies between words through self-attention, forms the basis of large language models (LLMs) that can perform tasks such as translation, summarization, question answering, and creative writing?
