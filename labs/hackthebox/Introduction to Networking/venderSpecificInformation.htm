          <h3><em>Vendor Specific Information</em></h3>

          <p>Cisco IOS is the operating system of Cisco network devices such as routers and switches. It provides features and services required to manage and operate network devices. This operating system comes in different versions and releases that vary in features, support, and performance. It offers several features required for the operation of modern networks, such as, but not limited to:
          <ul>
            <li>Support for IPv6</li>
            <li>Quality of Service (QoS)</li>
            <li>Security features such as encryption and authentication</li>
            <li>Virtualization features such as Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)</li>
            <li>Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Cisco IOS can be managed in several ways, depending on the network device and hardware used. The most commonly used method is the command line interface (CLI), which can also be managed in the graphical user interface (GUI). In addition, it supports various network protocols and services required for network operations. These include:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Routing protocols</b> - Such as OSPF and BGP are used to route data packets on a network.</li>

            <li><b>Switching protocols</b> - Such as VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) and Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is used to configure and manage switches on a network.</li>

            <li><b>Network services</b> - Such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) are used to automatically provide clients on the network with IP addresses and other network configurations.</li>

            <li><b>Security features</b> - Such as Access Control Lists (ACLs), which are used to control access to network resources and prevent security threats.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>In Cisco IOS, different types of passwords are used for various purposes, for example:</p>

          <p>Password Type - Description
          <ul>
            <li><b>User</b> - The user password is used for logging in to Cisco IOS. It is used to restrict access to the network device and its features.</li>

            <li><b>Enable Password</b> - The enable password is used to enter "enable" mode. The "enable" mode is the mode where you have access to advanced functions and settings.</li>

            <li><b>Secret</b> - The secret is a password to secure access to certain functions and services. It is often used to restrict access to remote management tools and services.</li>

            <li><b>Enable Secret</b> - The enable secret is an extra-secure password used to secure access to "enable" mode, and they are stored encrypted to provide additional protection.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>We highly recommend going through the provided external resources to understand the encryption mechanics of Cisco IOS and how those are used.</p>

          <p>The Cisco IOS devices can be configured for SSH or Telnet. So it can be accessed remotely. We can determine from the response we receive that it is indeed a Cisco IOS, as it responds with the User Access Verification message.</p>

          <h4>VLANs</h4>

          <p>Imagine this scenario: A startup called XQ hired a network administrator to create a network for their single-office company, and due to budget limitations, they can only afford one switch and router. The sysadmin of XQ stated that in addition to hosting the web and database servers in the network, staff from different departments will be using it. As a seasoned network security specialist, the network administrator immediately thought about the security attacks that an insider can perform, especially ones abusing broadcast traffic, such as broadcast storms. Therefore, to tackle this problem, the network administrator decided to logically segment the network with Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANS), conceptually breaking down one switch into smaller mini-switches.</p>

          <p>A VLAN is a logical grouping of network endpoints connected to defined ports on a switch, allowing the segmentation of networks by creating logical broadcast domains that can span multiple physical LAN segments. With VLANs, network administrators can segment networks based on factors such as team, function, department, or application, without worrying about the physical location of endpoints and users. A broadcast packet sent over one VLAN does not reach any other endpoint that is a member of another VLAN. Because each VLAN is regarded as a broadcast domain, it needs to have its own subnet; for example, the network administrator contracted by XQ can segment the network by departments:</p>

          <p>Department - VLAN ID - Subnet</p>

          <pre>
            Servers     VLAN 10   192.168.1.0/24
            C-Level     VLAN 20   192.168.2.0/24
            Finance     VLAN 30   192.168.3.0/24
            HR          VLAN 40   192.168.4.0/24
            Marketing   VLAN 50   192.168.5.0/24
            Support     VLAN 60   192.168.6.0/24
          </pre>

          <p>A myriad of benefits is attained when using VLANs, including:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Better Organization:</b> - Network administrators can group endpoints based on any common attribute they share.</li>

            <li><b>Increased Security:</b> - Network segmentation disallows unauthorized members from sniffing network packets in other VLANs.</li>

            <li><b>Simplified Administration:</b> Network administrators do not have to worry about the physical locations of an endpoint.</li>

            <li><b>Increased Performance:</b> - With reduced broadcast traffic for all endpoints, more bandwidth is made available for use by the network.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Cisco switches provide the VLAN IDs/numbers 1-4094 (0 and 4095 are reserved IDs and cannot be used); IDs 1-1005 (VLAN 1 is known as the default VLAN and cannot/should not be altered nor deleted) are known as normal-range VLANs, with IDs 1002-1005 being reserved for Token Ring and Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) VLANs, while IDs 1006-4094 are known as extended-range VLANs. By default, any customization applied for normal-range VLANs is saved in the VLAN database (the vlan.dat file), in contrast to extended-range VLANs, which do not have their customizations saved. VLANs 2-1001 stored in vlan.dat can have parameters including name, type, state, and maximum transmission unit (MTU).</p>

          <h4>VLAN Memberships</h4>

          <p>Network administrators can assign the ports of a switch to VLANs either statically or dynamically. Static VLAN assignment, which is the simplest and most common method, involves assigning each port to a VLAN manually using the switch's network operating system; this must be done for all switches separately (it is essential to keep in mind that endpoints connecting to these ports are unaware of the existence of VLANs). In contrast, dynamic VLAN assignment automatically determines an endpoint's VLAN membership based on MAC addresses or protocols. The system administrator can register the MAC addresses in a centralized VLAN management service/database, such as the VLAN Membership Policy Server (VMPS) service, and then the switch queries the database of VMPS to determine the VLAN of the endpoint with that specific MAC address. Regardless of their flexibility and mobility, dynamic VLANs increase administrative overhead.</p>

          <p>Security-wise, static VLANs are the more secure option because a port will forever be tied to a specific VLAN ID, unless changed manually afterward. For dynamic VLANs, an attacker could potentially utilize tools such as macchanger to spoof the MAC address of legitimate endpoints and attain membership of their VLANs, therefore sniffing all network traffic sent through them.</p>

          <h4>Access and Trunk Ports</h4>

          <p>Any port on a VLAN-enabled switch must be either an access port or a trunk port. Access ports belong to and can carry the traffic of only one VLAN (or in some cases two, with the second being for voice traffic); any traffic arriving on an access port is assumed to belong to the VLAN the port was assigned. On the other hand, trunk ports can carry multiple VLANs at the same time; trunk links connect two trunk ports on two switches (or a switch and router) to allow information from multiple VLANs to be carried out across switches.</p>

          <h4>VLAN Identification</h4>

          <p>Standard 802.3 Ethernet frames do not contain VLAN information; therefore, switches and other VLAN-enabled devices need a mechanism to keep track of all the VLAN information associated with a packet while traversing VLAN-enabled devices. Two main trunking methods are utilized to achieve this, ISL and IEEE 802.1Q.</p>

          <h4>Inter-Switch Link (ISL)</h4>

          <p>Inter-Switch Link (ISL) is a Cisco-proprietary protocol used for trunking between VLAN-enabled devices. Although ISL is one of the first trunking methods (predating 802.1Q), it is deprecated and not as widely used in modern Cisco switches (and routers). Instead, most only support the widely adopted 802.1Q. ISL encapsulated the entire Ethernet frame, including the original Ethernet header and the VLAN tag, adding its 26-byte header and 4-byte trailer.</p>

          <h4>IEEE 802.1Q</h4>

          <p>To ensure interoperability of VLAN technologies from the various network-equipments vendors, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) developed the 802.1Q specification in 1998. The IEEE 802 committee had to change the 802.3 Ethernet frame format by adding a pair of 2-byte fields, TPID and TCI (which consists of three subfields, PCP, DEI, and VID), resulting in a VLAN-compliant 802.1Q Ethernet frame.
          <ul>
            <li><a href="Images/802.3.png">8023 Legacy | 8021Q Ethernet Frames.png</a></li>
          </ul>

          <p>Tag protocol identifier (TPID) is a 16-bit field always set to 0x8100 to identify the Ethernet frame as an 802.1Q-tagged frame. Tag Control Information (TCI) is a 16-bit field containing Priority code point (PCP), Drop eligible indicator (DEI) (previously known as Canonical format indicator (CFI)), and VLAN identifier (VID). The main field concerning VLANs is VID, occupying the low-order 12-bits of TCI. Since it is 12 bits, it allows 2^12 - 2 = 4096 (remember, 0 and 4095 are reserved) VLAN IDs. Therefore, an 802.1Q-tagged frame can contain information for 4094 VLANs; the practice of inserting multiple 802.1Q tags within a single packet is known as Double Tagging, introduced by 802.1ad. VLAN tagging is the process of inserting VLAN information into an 802.1Q Ethernet header, while VLAN untagging is the process of removing the VLAN information from an 802.1Q-tagged Ethernet frame and forwarding the packet to the destined ports.</p>

          <h4>VLAN-Capable NICs</h4>

          <p>Some network interface cards (NICs) attached to computers/servers support VLAN tagging. Let us see how we can assign a VLAN ID to a NIC using Linux and Windows.</p>

          <h4>Assigning NICs a VLAN in Linux</h4>

          <p>In Linux, creating a VLAN is done by creating an interface on top of another, called a parent interface. This VLAN interface will tag packets with the assigned VLAN ID while returning packets will be untagged.</p>

          <p>To assign a network adapter a VLAN in Linux, many tools can be used, such as ip, nmcli, and vconfig (deprecated). However, first, we need to ensure that the Kernel has the 802.1Q module loaded:</p>

          <h5>kappajester83@htb[/htb]$ sudo modprobe 8021q</h5>

          <p>Subsequently, we can use lsmod to make sure 8021q was loaded successfully:</p>

          <pre>
            kappajester83@htb[/htb]$ lsmod | grep 8021
            
            8021q                  40960  0
            garp                   16384  1 8021q
            mrp                    20480  1 8021q
          </pre>

          <p>Now, we need to find the name of the physical Ethernet interface that we will create the VLAN interface on top of, which is eth0:</p>

          <pre>
            kappajester83@htb[/htb]$ ip a

            -SNIP-
            2: eth0: "BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP" mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
                link/ether a6:ba:3b:08:3a:36 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
                altname enp0s3
                altname ens3
                inet 94.2X.5X.72/22 brd 94.237.51.255 scope global dynamic eth0
                   valid_lft 83489sec preferred_lft 83489sec
                inet6 fe80::a4ba:3bff:fe08:3a36/64 scope link 
                   valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
          </pre>

          <p>Then, we will use vconfig to create a new interface that is a member of the desired VLAN, 20, for example, on top of eth0:</p>

          <pre>
            kappajester83@htb[/htb]$ sudo vconfig add eth0 20

            Warning: vconfig is deprecated and might be removed in the future, please migrate to ip(route2) as soon as possible!
          </pre>

          <p>To use ip instead:</p>

          <pre>
            kappajester83@htb[/htb]$ sudo ip link add link eth0 name eth0.20 type vlan id 20
          </pre>

          <p>Either of these commands will make a new interface called eth0.20@eth0:</p>

          <pre>
            kappajester83@htb[/htb]$ ip a

            -SNIP-
            4: eth0.20@eth0: "BROADCAST,MULTICAST" mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN group default qlen 1000
            link/ether a6:ba:3b:08:3a:36 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
          </pre>

          <p>Then, based on the subnet assigned to the addresses with VLAN 20 within the local network, we need to assign the interface an IP address and then start it:</p>

          <pre>
            kappajester83@htb[/htb]$ sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.1/24 dev eth0.20
            kappajester83@htb[/htb]$ sudo ip link set up eth0.20
          </pre>

          <p>At last, we can check whether the interface has changed states to up:</p>

          <pre>
            kappajester83@htb[/htb]$ ip a | grep eth0.20

            4: eth0.20@eth0: "BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP" mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qlen 1000
                inet 192.168.1.1/24 scope global eth0.20
          </pre>

          <h4>Assigning NICs a VLAN in Windows</h4>

          <p>On Windows, to assign a VLAN for a physical network adapter that supports VLAN tagging, first we need to open Device Manager:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="Images/device_manager.png">Windows_Device Manager.png</a></li>
          </ul>

          <p>Then we need to click on Properties for the Ethernet interface we want to assign to a VLAN:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="Images/adapter_properties.png">Windows Device Manager Adapter Properties.png</a></li>
          </ul>

          <p>Within Advanced, there will be a VLAN ID property to which we can assign a value. After clicking OK, if the adapter supports assigning a VLAN, it will be set; otherwise, the window will close, and no VLAN tag will be added to any packets originating from this host:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="images/adapter_VLAN_ID.png">Windows Device Manager Adapter Properties VLAN_ID.png</a></li>
          </ul>

          <p>Instead of relying on the GUI, we can use PowerShell. First, let us get the names of all the available physical network adapters using the Get-NetAdapter Cmdlet:</p>

          <pre>
            PS C:\> Get-NetAdapter | Format-Table -AutoSize

            Name                                           InterfaceDescription                                                          ifIndex Status             MacAddress              LinkSpeed

            Wi-Fi                                         Intel(R) Wireless-AC 9560 160MHz                                                12 Disconnected   8E-36-6A-7A-BA-6A 866.7 Mbps

            Previously, we used Device Manager to assign Ethernet 2 to VLAN 10; to retrieve the VLAN ID of the interface, we can use the Get-NetAdapaterAdvancedProperty Cmdlet with the -DisplayName flag along with vlan id:
            VLANs

            PS C:\> Get-NetAdapterAdvancedProperty -DisplayName "vlan id"

            Name                      DisplayName                    DisplayValue                   RegistryKeyword RegistryValue
            ----                      -----------                    ------------                   --------------- -------------
            Ethernet 2                VLAN ID                        10                                     VLAN_ID               {10}
          </pre>

          <p>We can also set the VLAN ID of a physical network address using the Set-NetAdapter Cmdlet along with the VlanID flag; this powerful Cmdlet can also be used to customize other properties of interfaces such as MAC addresses:</p>

          <pre>
            PS C:\> Set-NetAdapter -Name "Ethernet 2" -VlanID 10
          </pre>

          <p>However, remember that this operation only succeeds if the network interface supports this functionality; otherwise, PowerShell will throw an error indicating that the interface does not support it.</p>

          <h4>Analyzing VLAN Tagged Traffic</h4>

          <p>We can identify and analyze VLAN tagged traffic on a network with Wireshark using the vlan filter. For example, when analyzing a network packet dump, we can inspect packets with 802.1Q tagging using the filter vlan:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="Images/wireshark_VLAN_filter.png">Wireshark VLAN Filter.png</a></li>
          </ul>

          <p>Moreover, we can search for packets with a specific VLAN ID; for example, to search for packets having VLAN 10, we can use the filter vlan.id == 10:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="Images/wireshark_VLAN_ID_Filter.png">Wireshark VLAN ID Filter.png</a></li>
          </ul>

          <p>Additionally, to enumerate the used VLAN IDs from a packet dump, we can utilize tshark:</p>

          <pre>
            kappajester83@htb[/htb]$ tshark -r "The Ultimate PCAP v20221220.pcapng" -T fields -e vlan.id | sort -n -u

            70
            80
            90

          <h4>Security Implications and VLAN Attacks</h4>

          <p>Regardless of improving a network's security posture, adversaries can still circumvent the defensive mechanisms put forth by VLANs. Although in modern switched networks, the utilization of VLANs brings numerous advantages (such as simplified network maintenance and improved performance), it also introduces potential security risks, leading to various VLAN attacks. It is essential to grasp the underlying methodologies of these attacks and implement practical mitigation approaches to safeguard networks.</p>

          <h4>VLAN Hopping</h4>

          <p>VLAN hopping attacks enable traffic from one VLAN to be seen by another VLAN without the aid of a router. It exploits Cisco's Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP), a protocol used to automatically negotiate the formation of a trunk link between two Cisco devices. An adversary needs to configure a host to mimic/act like a switch to take advantage of the automatic trunking port feature enabled by default on most switch ports. To exploit VLAN hopping, an adversary must be able to physically connect with a switch port that has DTP enabled. The adversary can abuse this connection by configuring a host connected to the switch on that specific port to spoof 802.1Q signaling and the DTP packets. If successful, the switch will eventually establish a trunk link with the adversary's host, exposing the network packets, not only for a specific VLAN.</p>

          <p>We can use tools such as Yersinia to perform VLAN hopping attacks:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="Images/yersinia_DTP_attack.png">Yersinia DTP Attack.png</a></li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Double-tagging VLAN Hopping</h4>

          <p>The double-tagging VLAN hopping attack is an increasingly more sophisticated attack against VLANs. Although VLAN double-tagging is a legitimate practice that entities such as Internet Service Providers (ISPs) utilize (they can use their VLANs internally while carrying traffic from clients that are already VLAN tagged), adversaries can also attempt to abuse it. In a double-tagging VLAN hopping attack, an adversary embeds a hidden 802.1Q tag inside an Ethernet frame that already has an 802.1Q tag, allowing the frame to go to a different VLAN, which the original 802.1Q tag did not specify.</p>

          <p>An adversary can carry out this attack following three steps. Bare in mind that this attack only works if the adversary is connected to a port residing in the same VLAN as the native VLAN of the trunk port:
          <ul>
            <li>The adversary sends a double-tagged 802.1Q Ethernet frame to the switch with the outer header having the VLAN ID of the adversary, which is the same as the native VLAN of the trunk port. Assume that the native VLAN is VLAN 10 and that VLAN 30 is the VLAN the adversary wants to reach, where the victim resides.</li>

            <li>The outer 4-byte 802.1Q tag arrives on the switch, and it is seen to be destined for VLAN 10, the native VLAN. After removing the VLAN 10 tag, the frame is forwarded on all VLAN 10 ports. On the trunk port, the VLAN 10 tag is stripped (removed), and the packet is not re-tagged because it is part of the native VLAN. However, the VLAN 30 tag is still intact (not stripped), and the first switch has not inspected it.</li>

            <li>Subsequently, the switch will look only at the inner 802.1Q tag that the adversary sent, and it decides that the frame must be forwarded for VLAN 30, which is the adversary's chosen VLAN. Now, the second switch will either send the frame to the victim port directly or flood it, depending on whether there is an existing MAC address table entry for the victim host.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Scapy allows carrying out the double-tagging VLAN hopping attack, in addition to Yersinia:

          </ul>

          <h4>VXLAN</h4>

          <p>We mentioned previously that the VID field within the '802.1Q' header inside an 'Ethernet' frame is only 12 bits, allowing for 4094 VLANs. While this number of VLANs might be sufficient for small networks, more is needed for data centers and cloud service providers, which require extensive segmentation. Additionally, current Layer 2 networks utilize the IEEE 802.1D Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) to prevent network loops caused by redundant paths. However, some data center operators encounter limitations with STP, such as link blocking, which reduces available ports and prevents resiliency through multipathing. These challenges hinder network efficiency in virtualized environments that rely on Layer 2 physical infrastructure. A critical requirement in such environments is the seamless scalability of the Layer 2 network across the entire data center and even between data centers to allocate computing, networking, and storage resources efficiently. Nevertheless, traditional approaches like STP, while ensuring a loop-free topology, can deactivate many links, further exacerbating the problem.</p>

          <p>RFC7348 offers a solution to these problems and limitations in Layer 2 networks by introducing Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network (VXLAN), which is essentially a 'Layer 2 overlay scheme on a Layer 3 network.' VXLAN is specifically designed to address the limitations of traditional Layer 2 networks and cater to the requirements of Layer 2 and Layer 3 data center network infrastructures in a multi-tenant environment with virtual machines (VMs). Operating over the existing networking infrastructure, VXLAN provides an innovative way to seamlessly extend a Layer 2 network. Its primary objective is to facilitate the scaling of Layer 2 networks across expansive data center landscapes, even spanning multiple physical data locations. Each VXLAN overlay is termed a VXLAN segment, ensuring that only VMs within the same VXLAN segment can communicate with each other, thus maintaining network isolation and security. A 24-bit segment ID, known as the VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI), uniquely identifies each VXLAN segment. Adopting VXLAN allows for the coexistence of 16 million VXLAN segments within the same administrative domain, providing scalability and flexibility for modern data centers and virtualized environments.</p>

          <h4>Cisco Discovery Protocol</h4>

          <p>Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) is a layer-2 network protocol from Cisco that is used by Cisco devices such as routers, switches, and bridges to gather information about other directly connected Cisco devices. This information can be used to discover and track the network's topology and help manage and troubleshoot the network. This protocol is usually enabled in Cisco devices, but it can be disabled if it is not needed or if it should be disabled for security reasons.</p>

          <h4>CDP Network Traffic</h4>

          <pre>
            22:14:11.563654 CDPv2, ttl: 180s, checksum: 0xebc1 (incorrect -> 0x8b71), length: 180

          </pre>

          <p>The shown message contains information about the device itself, such as the device name, IP address, port name, and functionality of the router, as well as information about the operating system and hardware platform of the device. Besides, we can see in the first line from the CDPv2 that we are dealing with the Cisco Discovery Protocol.</p>

          <p>For comparison, we can look at another protocol called Spanning Tree Protocol (STP). The STP is a network protocol that ensures no loops in a network with multiple connections between switches. There are no loops, and it prevents data packets from circulating in a loop and congesting the network.</p>

          <h4>STP Network Traffic</h4>

          <pre>
            22:14:11.563654 STP 802.1w, Rapid STP, Flags [Learn, Forward], bridge-id 8001.00:11:22:33:44:55.8000, length 43
                    root-id 8001.AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA, cost 0, port-id 8001, message-age 0.00s, max-age 20.00s, hello-time 2.00s, forward-delay 15.00s
          </pre>

          <p>In this example, we see that an STP message was sent containing information about the root switch, the MAC address of the root switch, the ID of the port over which the message was sent, and other configuration parameters such as the maximum aging time, hello time, and forward delay.</p>
