          <h3><em>Network Configuration</em></h3>

          <p>As a penetration tester, one of the key skills required is configuring and managing network settings on Linux systems. This skill is valuable in setting up testing environments, controlling network traffic, or identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities. By understanding Linux's network configuration options, we can tailor our testing approach to suit our specific needs and optimize our results.</p>

          <p>One of the primary network configuration tasks is configuring network interfaces. This includes assigning IP addresses, configuring network devices such as routers and switches, and setting up network protocols. It is essential to thoroughly understand the network protocols and their specific use cases, such as TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP, and FTP. Additionally, we should be familiar with different network interfaces, including wireless and wired connections, and be able to troubleshoot connectivity issues.</p>

          <p>Network access control is another critical component of network configuration. As penetration testers, we should be familiar with the importance of NAC for network security and the different NAC technologies available. These include:
          <ul>
            <li>Discretionary access control (DAC)</li>
            <li>Mandatory access control (MAC)</li>
            <li>Role-based access control (RBAC)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>We should also understand the different NAC enforcement mechanisms and know how to configure Linux network devices for NAC. This includes setting up SELinux policies, configuring AppArmor profiles, and using TCP wrappers to control access.</p>

          <p>Monitoring network traffic is also an essential part of network configuration. Therefore, we should know how to configure network monitoring and logging and be able to analyze network traffic for security purposes. Tools such as syslog, rsyslog, ss, lsof, and the ELK stack can be used to monitor network traffic and identify security issues.</p>

          <p>Moreover, good knowledge of network troubleshooting tools is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities and interacting with other networks and hosts. In addition to the tools we mentioned, we can use ping, nslookup, and nmap to diagnose and enumerate networks. These tools can provide valuable insight into network traffic, packet loss, latency, DNS resolution, etc. By understanding how to use these tools effectively, we can quickly pinpoint the root cause of any network problem and take the necessary steps to resolve it.</p>

          <h4>Configuring Network Interfaces</h4>

          <p>When working with Ubuntu, you can configure local network interfaces using the ifconfig or the ip command. These powerful commands allow us to view and configure our system's network interfaces. Whether we're looking to make changes to our existing network setup or need to check on the status of our interfaces, these commands can greatly simplify the process. Moreover, developing a firm grasp on the intricacies of network interfaces is an essential ability in the modern, interconnected world. With the rapid advancement of technology and the increasing reliance on digital communication, having a comprehensive knowledge of how to work with network interfaces can enable you to navigate the diverse array of networks that exist nowadays effectively.</p>

          <p>One way to obtain information regarding network interfaces, such as IP addresses, netmasks, and status, is by using the ifconfig command. By executing this command, we can view the available network interfaces and their respective attributes in a clear and organized manner. This information can be particularly useful when troubleshooting network connectivity issues or setting up a new network configuration. It should be noted that the ifconfig command has been deprecated in newer versions of Linux and replaced by the ip command, which offers more advanced features. Nevertheless, the ifconfig command is still widely used in many Linux distributions and continues to be a reliable tool for network management.</p>

          </h5>

          <p>When it comes to activating network interfaces, ifconfig and ip commands are two commonly used tools. These commands allow users to modify and activate settings for a specific interface, such as eth0. We can adjust the network settings to suit our needs by using the appropriate syntax and specifying the interface name.</p>

          <h4>Activate Network Interface</h4>

          <h5>
            kalijester68@htb[/htb]$ sudo ifconfig eth0 up # OR<br>
            kalijester68@htb[/htb]$ sudo ip link set eth0 up
          </h5>

          <p>One way to allocate an IP address to a network interface is by utilizing the ifconfig command. We must specify the interface's name and IP address as arguments to do this. This is a crucial step in setting up a network connection. The IP address serves as a unique identifier for the interface and enables the communication between devices on the network.</p>

          <h4>Assign IP Address to an Interface</h4>

          <h5>kalijester68@htb[/htb]$ sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.2</h5>

          <p>To set the netmask for a network interface, we can run the following command with the name of the interface and the netmask:</p>

          <h4>Assign a Netmask to an Interface</h4>

          <h5>kalijester68@htb[/htb]$ sudo ifconfig eth0 netmask 255.255.255.0</h5>

          <p>When we want to set the default gateway for a network interface, we can use the route command with the add option. This allows us to specify the gateway's IP address and the network interface to which it should be applied. By setting the default gateway, we are designating the IP address of the router that will be used to send traffic to destinations outside the local network. Ensuring that the default gateway is set correctly is important, as incorrect configuration can lead to connectivity issues.</p>

          <h4>Assign the Route to an Interface</h4>

          <h5>kalijester68@htb[/htb]$ sudo route add default gw 192.168.1.1 eth0</h5>

          <p>When configuring a network interface, it is often necessary to set Domain Name System (DNS) servers to ensure proper network functionality. DNS servers translate domain names into IP addresses, allowing devices to connect with each other on the internet. By setting those, we can ensure that their devices can communicate with other devices and access websites and other online resources. Without proper DNS server configuration, devices may experience network connectivity issues and be unable to access certain online resources. This can be achieved by updating the /etc/resolv.conf file with the appropriate DNS server information. The /etc/resolv.conf file is a plain text file containing the system's DNS information. The system can properly resolve domain names to IP addresses by adding the required DNS servers to this file. It is important to note that any changes made to this file will only apply to the current session and must be updated if the system is restarted or the network configuration is changed.</p>

          <h4>Editing DNS Settings</h4>

          <h5>
            kalijester68@htb[/htb]$ sudo vim /etc/resolv.conf<br>
            <br>
            /etc/resolv.conf<br>
            Code: txt<br>
            <br>
            nameserver 8.8.8.8<br>
            nameserver 8.8.4.4
          </h5>

          <p>After completing the necessary modifications to the network configuration, it is essential to ensure that these changes are saved to persist across reboots. This can be achieved by editing the /etc/network/interfaces file, which defines network interfaces for Linux-based operating systems. Thus, it is vital to save any changes made to this file to avoid any potential issues with network connectivity.</p>

          <h4>Editing Interfaces</h4>

          <h5>kalijester68@htb[/htb]$ sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces</h5>

          <p>This will open the interfaces file in the vim editor. We can add the network configuration settings to the file like this:</p>

          <h5>
            /etc/network/interfaces<br>
            <br>
            Code: txt<br>
            <br>
            auto eth0<br>
            iface eth0 inet static<br>
            address 192.168.1.2<br>
            netmask 255.255.255.0<br>
            gateway 192.168.1.1<br>
            dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
          </h5>

          <p>By setting the eth0 network interface to use a static IP address of 192.168.1.2, with a netmask of 255.255.255.0 and a default gateway of 192.168.1.1, we can ensure that your network connection remains stable and reliable. Additionally, by specifying DNS servers of 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4, we can ensure that our computer can easily access the internet and resolve domain names. Once we have made these changes to the configuration file, saving the file and exiting the editor is important. After that, we must restart the networking service to apply the changes.</p>

          <h4>Restart Networking Service</h4>

          <h5>kalijester68@htb[/htb]$ sudo systemctl restart networking</h5>

          <h4>Network Access Control</h4>

          <p>Network access control (NAC) is a crucial component of network security, especially in today's era of increasing cyber threats. As a penetration tester, it is vital to understand the significance of NAC in protecting the network and the various NAC technologies that can be utilized to enhance security measures. NAC is a security system that ensures that only authorized and compliant devices are granted access to the network, preventing unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats. By implementing NAC, organizations can be confident in their ability to protect their assets and data from cybercriminals who always seek to exploit system vulnerabilities. The following are the different NAC technologies that can be used to enhance security measures:
          <ul>
            <li>Discretionary access control (DAC)</li>
            <li>Mandatory access control (MAC)</li>
            <li>Role-based access control (RBAC)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>These technologies are designed to provide different levels of access control and security. Each technology has its unique characteristics and is suitable for different use cases. As a penetration tester, it is essential to understand these technologies and their specific use cases to test and evaluate the network's security effectively.</p>

          <h4>Discretionary Access Control</h4>

          <p>DAC is a crucial component of modern security systems as it helps organizations provide access to their resources while managing the associated risks of unauthorized access. It is a widely used access control system that enables users to manage access to their resources by granting resource owners the responsibility of controlling access permissions to their resources. This means that users and groups who own a specific resource can decide who has access to their resources and what actions they are authorized to perform. These permissions can be set for reading, writing, executing, or deleting the resource.</p>

          <h4>Mandatory Access Control</h4>

          <p>MAC is used in infrastructure that provides more fine-grained control over resource access than DAC systems. Those systems define rules that determine resource access based on the resource's security level and the user's security level or process requesting access. Each resource is assigned a security label that identifies its security level, and each user or process is assigned a security clearance that identifies its security level. Access to a resource is only granted if the user's or process's security level is equal to or greater than the security level of the resource. MAC is often used in operating systems and applications that require a high level of security, such as military or government systems, financial systems, and healthcare systems. MAC systems are designed to prevent unauthorized access to resources and minimize the impact of security breaches.</p>

          <h4>Role-based Access Control</h4>

          <p>RBAC assigns permissions to users based on their roles within an organization. Users are assigned roles based on their job responsibilities or other criteria, and each role is granted a set of permissions that determine the actions they can perform. RBAC simplifies the management of access permissions, reduces the risk of errors, and ensures that users can access only the resources necessary to perform their job functions. It can restrict access to sensitive resources and data, limit the impact of security breaches, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. Compared to Discretionary Access Control (DAC) systems, RBAC provides a more flexible and scalable approach to managing resource access. In an RBAC system, each user is assigned one or more roles, and each role is assigned a set of permissions that define the user's actions. Resource access is granted based on the user's assigned role rather than their identity or ownership of the resource. RBAC systems are typically used in environments with many users and resources, such as large organizations, government agencies, and financial institutions.</p>

          <h4>Monitoring</h4>

          <p>Network monitoring involves capturing, analyzing, and interpreting network traffic to identify security threats, performance issues, and suspicious behavior. The primary goal of analyzing and monitoring network traffic is identifying security threats and vulnerabilities. For example, as penetration testers, we can capture credentials when someone uses an unencrypted connection and tries to log in to an FTP server. As a result, we will obtain this user’s credentials that might help us to infiltrate the network even further or escalate our privileges to a higher level. In short, by analyzing network traffic, we can gain insights into network behavior and identify patterns that may indicate security threats. Such analysis includes detecting suspicious network activity, identifying malicious traffic, and identifying potential security risks. However, we cover this vast topic in the Intro to Network Traffic Analysis module, where we use several tools for network monitoring on Linux systems like Ubuntu and Windows systems, like Wireshark, tshark, and Tcpdump.</p>

          <h4>Troubleshooting</h4>

          <p>Network troubleshooting is an essential process that involves diagnosing and resolving network issues that can adversely affect the performance and reliability of the network. This process is critical for ensuring the network operates optimally and avoiding disruptions that could impact business operations during our penetration tests. It also involves identifying, analyzing, and implementing solutions to resolve problems. Such problems include connectivity problems, slow network speeds, and network errors. Various tools can help us identify and resolve issues regarding network troubleshooting on Linux systems. Some of the most commonly used tools include:
          <ul>
            <li>Ping</li>
            <li>Traceroute</li>
            <li>Netstat</li>
            <li>Tcpdump</li>
            <li>Wireshark</li>
            <li>Nmap</li>
          </ul>

          <p>By using these tools and others like them, we can better understand how the network functions and quickly diagnose any issues that may arise. For example, ping is a command-line tool used to test connectivity between two devices. It sends packets to a remote host and measures the time to return them. To use ping, we can enter the following command:</p>

          <h4>Ping</h4>

          <h5>kalijester68@htb[/htb]$ ping "remote_host"</h5>

          <p>For example, pinging the Google DNS server will send ICMP packets to the Google DNS server and display the response times.</p>

          <h5>
            kalijester68@htb[/htb]$ ping 8.8.8.8<br>
            <br>
            PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.<br>
            64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=119 time=1.61 ms<br>
            64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=119 time=1.06 ms<br>
            64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=3 ttl=119 time=0.636 ms<br>
            64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=4 ttl=119 time=0.685 ms<br>
            ^C<br>
            --- 8.8.8.8 ping statistics ---<br>
            4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 3017ms<br>
            rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.636/0.996/1.607/0.388 ms
          </h5>

          <p>Another tool is the traceroute, which traces the route packets take to reach a remote host. It sends packets with increasing Time-to-Live (TTL) values to a remote host and displays the IP addresses of the devices that the packets pass through. For example, to trace the route to the Google DNS server, we would enter the following command:</p>

          <h4>Traceroute</h4>

          <h5>
            kalijester68@htb[/htb]$ traceroute www.inlanefreight.com<br>
            <br>

          </h5>

          <p>This will display the IP addresses of the devices that the packets pass through to reach the Google DNS server. The output of a traceroute command shows how it is used to trace the path of packets to the website www.inlanefreight.com, which has an IP address of 134.209.24.248. Each line of the output contains valuable information.</p>

          <p>When setting up a network connection, it's important to specify the destination host and IP address. In this example, the destination host is 134.209.24.248, and the maximum number of hops allowed is 30. This ensures that the connection is established efficiently and reliably. By providing this information, the system can route traffic to the correct destination and limit the number of intermediate stops the data needs to make.</p>

          <p>The second line shows the first hop in the traceroute, which is the local network gateway with the IP address 10.80.71.5, followed by the next three columns show the time it took for each of the three packets sent to reach the gateway in milliseconds (2.716 ms, 2.700 ms, and 2.730 ms).</p>

          <p>Next, we see the second hop in the traceroute. However, there was no response from the device at that hop, indicated by the three asterisks instead of the IP address. This could mean the device is down, blocking ICMP traffic, or a network issue caused the packets to drop.</p>

          <p>In the fourth line, we can see the third hop in the traceroute, consisting of two devices with IP addresses 10.80.68.175 and 10.80.68.161, and again the next three columns show the time it took for each of the three packets to reach the first device (7.147 ms, 7.132 ms, and 7.393 ms).</p>

          <h4>Netstat</h4>

          <p>Netstat is used to display active network connections and their associated ports. It can be used to identify network traffic and troubleshoot connectivity issues. To use netstat, we can enter the following command:</p>

          <h5>
            kalijester68@htb[/htb]$ netstat -a<br>
            <br>
            Active Internet connections (servers and established)<br>
            Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address Foreign Address State <br>
            tcp 0 0 localhost:5901 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN <br>
            tcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:sunrpc 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN <br>
            tcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:http 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN <br>
            tcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:ssh 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN<br>
            ...SNIP...
          </h5>

          <p>We can expect to receive detailed information about each connection when using this tool. This includes the protocol used, the number of bytes received and sent, IP addresses, port numbers of both local and remote devices, and the current connection state. The output provides valuable insights into the network activity on the system, highlighting four specific connections currently active and listening on specific ports. These connections include the VNC remote desktop software, the Sun Remote Procedure Call service, the HTTP protocol for web traffic, and the SSH protocol for secure remote shell access. By knowing which ports are used by which services, users can quickly identify any network issues and troubleshoot accordingly. The most common network issues we will encounter during our penetration tests include the following:
          <ul>
            <li>Network connectivity issues</li>
            <li>DNS resolution issues (it's always DNS)</li>
            <li>Packet loss</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Network performance issues</h4>

          <p>Each issue, along with common causes that may include misconfigured firewalls or routers, damaged network cables or connectors, incorrect network settings, hardware failure, incorrect DNS server settings, DNS server failure, misconfigured DNS records, network congestion, outdated network hardware, incorrectly configured network settings, unpatched software or firmware, and lack of proper security controls. Understanding these common network issues and their causes is important for effectively identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in network systems during our testing.</p>

          <h4>Hardening</h4>

          <p>Several mechanisms are highly effective in securing Linux systems in keeping our and other companies' data safe. Three such mechanisms are SELinux, AppArmor, and TCP wrappers. These tools are designed to safeguard Linux systems against various security threats, from unauthorized access to malicious attacks, especially while conducting a penetration test. There is almost no worse scenario than when a company is compromised due to a penetration test. By implementing these security measures and ensuring that we set up corresponding protection against potential attackers, we can significantly reduce the risk of data leaks and ensure our systems remain secure. While these tools share some similarities, they also have important differences.</p>

          <p>SELinux is a MAC system that is built into the Linux kernel. It is designed to provide fine-grained access control over system resources and applications. SELinux works by enforcing a policy that defines the access controls for each process and file on the system. It provides a higher level of security by limiting the damage that a compromised process can do.</p>

          <p>AppArmor is also a MAC system that provides a similar level of control over system resources and applications, but it works slightly differently. AppArmor is implemented as a Linux Security Module (LSM) and uses application profiles to define the resources that an application can access. AppArmor is typically easier to use and configure than SELinux but may not provide the same level of fine-grained control.</p>

          <p>TCP wrappers are a host-based network access control mechanism that can be used to restrict access to network services based on the IP address of the client system. It works by intercepting incoming network requests and comparing the IP address of the client system to the access control rules. These are useful for limiting access to network services from unauthorized systems.</p>

          <p>Regarding similarities, the three security mechanisms share the common goal of ensuring the safety and security of Linux systems. In addition to providing extra protection, they can restrict access to resources and services, thus reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. It's also worth noting that these mechanisms are readily available as part of most Linux distributions, making them accessible to us to enhance their systems' security. Furthermore, these mechanisms can be easily customized and configured using standard tools and utilities, making them a convenient choice for Linux users.</p>

          <p>In terms of differences, SELinux and AppArmor are both MAC systems that provide fine-grained access control over system resources but work in different ways. SELinux is built into the kernel and is more complex to configure and use, while AppArmor is implemented as a module and is typically easier to use. On the other hand, TCP wrappers are a host-based network access control mechanism designed to restrict access to network services based on the IP address of the client system. It is a simpler mechanism than SELinux and AppArmor but is useful for limiting access to network services from unauthorized systems.</p>

          <h4>Setting Up</h4>

          <p>As we navigate the world of Linux, we inevitably encounter a wide range of technologies, applications, and services that we need to become familiar with. This is a crucial skill, particularly if we work in cybersecurity and strive to improve our expertise continuously. For this reason, we highly recommend dedicating time to learning about configuring important security measures such as SELinux, AppArmor, and TCP wrappers on your own. By taking on this (optional but highly efficient) challenge, you'll deepen your understanding of these technologies, build up your problem-solving skills, and gain valuable experience that will serve you well in the future. We highly recommend to use a personal VM and make snapshots before making changes.</p>

          <p>When it comes to implementing cybersecurity measures, there is no one-size-fits-all approach. It is important to consider the specific information you want to protect and the tools you will use to do so. However, you can practice and implement several optional tasks with others in the Discord channel to increase your knowledge and skills in this area. By taking advantage of the helpfulness of others and sharing your own expertise, you can deepen your understanding of cybersecurity and help others do the same. Remember, explaining concepts to others is essential to teaching and learning.</p>
