          <h3><em>Network Services</em></h3>

          <p>When we work with Linux, we also have to deal with different network services. The competence to work with these network services is essential for many reasons. Among other things, we need this knowledge and ability to communicate with other computers over the network, connect, transfer files, analyze network traffic, and learn how to configure such services to identify potential vulnerabilities in our later penetration tests. This knowledge also pushes our understanding of network security as we learn what options each service and its configuration entails.</p>

          <p>Let's imagine that we are performing a penetration test and come across a Linux host that we are probing for vulnerabilities. Listening to the network, we can see that a user from this Linux host connects to another server via an unencrypted FTP server. Accordingly, we can detect the credentials of the user in clear text. Of course, the likelihood of this scenario occurring would be much lower if the user knew that FTP does not encrypt the connections and the data sent. And as a Linux administrator, this could be a fatal error, as it tells us not only a lot about the security measures on the network but also about the administrator(s) who are responsible for the security of their network.</p>

          <p>We will not be able to cover all network services, but we will focus on and cover the most important ones. Because not only from the perspective of an administrator and user, it is of great benefit but also as a penetration tester for the interaction between other hosts and our machine.</p>

          <h4>SSH</h4>

          <p>Secure Shell (SSH) is a network protocol that allows the secure transmission of data and commands over a network. It is widely used to securely manage remote systems and securely access remote systems to execute commands or transfer files. In order to connect to our or a remote Linux host via SSH, a corresponding SSH server must be available and running.</p>

          <p>The most commonly used SSH server is the OpenSSH server. OpenSSH is a free and open-source implementation of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol that allows the secure transmission of data and commands over a network.</p>

          <p>Administrators use OpenSSH to securely manage remote systems by establishing an encrypted connection to a remote host. With OpenSSH, administrators can execute commands on remote systems, securely transfer files, and establish a secure remote connection without the transmission of data and commands being intercepted by third parties.</p>

          <h4>Install OpenSSH</h4>

          <h5>kalijester68@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt install openssh-server -y</h5>

          <p>To check if the server is running, we can use the following command:</p>

          <h4>Server Status</h4>

          <h5>
            kalijester68@htb[/htb]$ systemctl status ssh<br>
            <br>

            └─7740 sshd: /usr/sbin/sshd -D [listener] 0 of 10-100 startups
          </h5>

          <p>As penetration testers, we use OpenSSH to securely access remote systems when performing a network audit. To do this, we can use the following command:</p>

          <h4>SSH - Logging In</h4>

          <h5>
            kalijester68@htb[/htb]$ ssh cry0l1t3@10.129.17.122<br>
            <br>
            The authenticity of host '10.129.17.122 (10.129.17.122)' can't be established.<br>
            ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:bKzhv+n2pYqr2r...Egf8LfqaHNxk.<br>
            Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes<br>
            <br>
            Warning: Permanently added '10.129.17.122' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.<br>
            <br>
            cry0l1t3@10.129.17.122's password: ***********
          </h5>

          <p>OpenSSH can be configured and customized by editing the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config with a text editor. Here we can adjust settings such as the maximum number of concurrent connections, the use of passwords or keys for logins, host key checking, and more. However, it is important for us to note that changes to the OpenSSH configuration file must be done carefully.</p>

          <p>For example, we can use SSH to securely log in to a remote system and execute commands or use tunneling and port forwarding to tunnel data over an encrypted connection to verify network settings and other system settings without the possibility of third parties intercepting the transmission of data and commands.</p>

          <h4>NFS</h4>

          <p>Network File System (NFS) is a network protocol that allows us to store and manage files on remote systems as if they were stored on the local system. It enables easy and efficient management of files across networks. For example, administrators use NFS to store and manage files centrally (for Linux and Windows systems) to enable easy collaboration and management of data. For Linux, there are several NFS servers, including NFS-UTILS (Ubuntu), NFS-Ganesha (Solaris), and OpenNFS (Redhat Linux).</p>

          <p>It can also be used to share and manage resources efficiently, e.g., to replicate file systems between servers. It also offers features such as access controls, real-time file transfer, and support for multiple users accessing data simultaneously. We can use this service just like FTP in case there is no FTP client installed on the target system, or NFS is running instead of FTP.</p>

          <h4>Install NFS on Linux</h4>

          <h5>kalijester68@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server -y</h5>

          <p>To check if the server is running, we can use the following command:</p>

          <h5>
            kalijester68@htb[/htb]$ systemctl status nfs-kernel-server<br>
            <br>
            nfs-server.service - NFS server and services<br>

            CPU: 10ms
          </h5>

          <p>We can configure NFS via the configuration file /etc/exports. This file specifies which directories should be shared and the access rights for users and systems. It is also possible to configure settings such as the transfer speed and the use of encryption. NFS access rights determine which users and systems can access the shared directories and what actions they can perform. Here are some important access rights that can be configured in NFS:</p>

          <p>Permissions
          <ul>
            <li><b>rw</b> - Gives users and systems read and write permissions to the shared directory.</li>
            <li><b>ro</b> - Gives users and systems read-only access to the shared directory.</li>
            <li><b>no_root_squash</b> - Prevents the root user on the client from being restricted to the rights of a normal user.</li>
            <li><b>root_squash</b> - Restricts the rights of the root user on the client to the rights of a normal user.</li>
            <li><b>sync</b> - Synchronizes the transfer of data to ensure that changes are only transferred after they have been saved on the file system.</li>
            <li><b>async</b> - Transfers data asynchronously, which makes the transfer faster, but may cause inconsistencies in the file system if changes have not been fully committed.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>For example, we can create a new folder and share it temporarily in NFS. We would do this as follows:</p>

          <h4>Create NFS Share</h4>

          <h5>
            cry0l1t3@htb:~$ mkdir nfs_sharing<br>
            cry0l1t3@htb:~$ echo '/home/cry0l1t3/nfs_sharing hostname(rw,sync,no_root_squash)' >> /etc/exports<br>
            cry0l1t3@htb:~$ cat /etc/exports | grep -v "#"<br>
            <br>
            /home/cry0l1t3/nfs_sharing hostname(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
          </h5>

          <p>If we have created an NFS share and want to work with it on the target system, we have to mount it first. We can do this with the following command:</p>

          <h4>Mount NFS Share</h4>

          <h5>
            cry0l1t3@htb:~$ mkdir ~/target_nfs<br>
            cry0l1t3@htb:~$ mount 10.129.12.17:/home/john/dev_scripts ~/target_nfs<br>
            cry0l1t3@htb:~$ tree ~/target_nfs<br>

            target_nfs/<br>
            ├── css.css<br>
            ├── html.html<br>
            ├── javascript.js<br>
            ├── php.php<br>
            └── xml.xml<br>
            <br>
            0 directories, 5 files
          </h5>

          <p>So we have mounted the NFS share (dev_scripts) from our target (10.129.12.17) locally to our system in the mount point target_nfs over the network and can view the contents just as if we were on the target system. There are even some methods that can be used in specific cases to escalate our privileges on the remote system using NFS.</p>

          <h4>Web Server</h4>

          <p>As penetration testers, we need to understand how web servers work because they are a critical part of web applications and often serve as targets for us to attack. A web server is a type of software that provides data and documents or other applications and functions over the Internet. They use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to send data to clients such as web browsers and receive requests from those clients. These are then rendered in the form of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) in the client's browser. This type of communication allows the client to create dynamic web pages that respond to the client's requests. Therefore, it is important that we understand the various functions of the web server in order to create secure and efficient web applications and also ensure the security of the system. Some of the most popular web servers for Linux servers are Apache, Nginx, Lighttpd, and Caddy. Apache is one of the most popular and widely used web servers and is available on a variety of operating systems, including Ubuntu, Solaris, and Redhat Linux.</p>

          <p>As penetration testers, we can use web servers for a variety of purposes. For example, we can use a web server to perform file transfers, allowing us to log in and interact with a target system through an incoming HTTP or HTTPS port. Finally, we can use a web server to perform phishing attacks by hosting a copy of the target page on our own server and then attempting to steal user credentials. In addition, there is a variety of other possibilities.</p>

          <p>Apache web server has a variety of features that allow us to host a secure and efficient web application. Moreover, we can also configure logging to get information about the traffic on our server, which helps us analyze attacks. We can install Apache using the following command:</p>

          <h4>Install Apache Web Server</h4>

          <h5>kalijester68@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt install apache2 -y</h5>

          <p>For Apache2, to specify which folders can be accessed, we can edit the file /etc/apache2/apache2.conf with a text editor. This file contains the global settings. We can change the settings to specify which directories can be accessed and what actions can be performed on those directories.</p>

          <h4>Apache Configuration</h4>

          <h5>
            Code: txt<br>
            <br>
            "Directory /var/www/html"<br>
            Options Indexes FollowSymLinks<br>
            AllowOverride All<br>
            Require all granted<br>
            "/directory"
          </h5>

          <p>This section specifies that the default /var/www/html folder is accessible, that users can use the Indexes and FollowSymLinks options, that changes to files in this directory can be overridden with AllowOverride All, and that Require all granted grants all users access to this directory. For example, if we want to transfer files to one of our target systems using a web server, we can put the appropriate files in the /var/www/html folder and use wget or curl or other applications to download these files on the target system.</p>

          <p>It is also possible to customize individual settings at the directory level by using the .htaccess file, which we can create in the directory in question. This file allows us to configure certain directory-level settings, such as access controls, without having to customize the Apache configuration file. We can also add modules to get features like mod_rewrite, mod_security, and mod_ssl that help us improve the security of our web application.</p>

          <p>Python Web Server is a simple, fast alternative to Apache and can be used to host a single folder with a single command to transfer files to another system. To install Python Web Server, we need to install Python3 on our system and then run the following command:</p>

          <h4>Install Python & Web Server</h4>

          <h5>
            kalijester68@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt install python3 -y<br>
            kalijester68@htb[/htb]$ python3 -m http.server<br>
            CTRL + z (back to terminal)
          </h5>

          <p>When we run this command, our Python Web Server will be started on the TCP/8000 port, and we can access the folder we are currently in. We can also host another folder with the following command:
          <p>

          <h5>kalijester68@htb[/htb]$ python3 -m http.server --directory /home/cry0l1t3/target_files</h5>

          <p>This will start a Python web server on the TCP/8000 port, and we can access the /home/cry0l1t3/target_files folder from the browser, for example. When we access our Python web server, we can transfer files to the other system by typing the link in our browser and downloading the files. We can also host our Python web server on a port other than the default port by using the -p option:</p>

          <h5>kalijester68@htb[/htb]$ python3 -m http.server 443</h5>

          <p>This will host our Python web server on port 443 instead of the default TCP/8000 port. We can access this web server by typing the link in our browser.</p>

          <h4>VPN</h4>

          <p>Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a technology that allows us to connect securely to another network as if we were directly in it. This is done by creating an encrypted tunnel connection between the client and the server, which means that all data transmitted over this connection is encrypted.</p>

          <p>VPNs are mainly used by companies to provide their employees with secure access to the internal network without having to be physically located at the corporate network. This allows employees to access the internal network and its resources and applications from any location. In addition, VPNs can also be used to anonymize traffic and prevent outside access.</p>

          <p>Some of the most popular VPN servers for Linux servers are OpenVPN, L2TP/IPsec, PPTP, SSTP, and SoftEther. OpenVPN is a popular open-source VPN server available for various operating systems, including Ubuntu, Solaris, and Redhat Linux. OpenVPN is used by administrators for various purposes, including enabling secure remote access to the corporate network, encrypting network traffic, and anonymizing traffic.</p>

          <p>OpenVPN can also be used by us as a penetration tester to connect to internal networks. It can happen that a VPN access is created by the customer so that we can test the internal network for security vulnerabilities. This is an alternative for cases when the penetration tester is too far away from the customer. OpenVPN provides us with a variety of features, including encryption, tunneling, traffic shaping, network routing, and the ability to adapt to dynamically changing networks. We can install the server and client with the following command:</p>

          <h4>Install OpenVPN</h4>

          <h5>kalijester68@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt install openvpn -y</h5>

          <p>OpenVPN can be customized and configured by editing the configuration file /etc/openvpn/server.conf. This file contains the settings for the OpenVPN server. We can change the settings to configure certain features such as encryption, tunneling, traffic shaping, etc.</p>

          <p>If we want to connect to an OpenVPN server, we can use the .ovpn file we received from the server and save it on our system. We can do this with the following command on the command line:</p>

          <h4>Connect to VPN</h4>

          <h5>kalijester68@htb[/htb]$ sudo openvpn --config internal.ovpn</h5>
